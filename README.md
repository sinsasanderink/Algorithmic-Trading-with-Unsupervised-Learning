# Algorithmic Trading with Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that outlines a complete workflow for developing a quantitative trading strategy using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to uncover latent structures in market data that can be exploited to inform trading decisions.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Use unsupervised learning to segment market data into clusters representing different market regimes, and develop a trading strategy based on these insights.

- **Approach:**  
  The strategy involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering analysis, signal generation, and backtesting to assess the strategy's effectiveness.

## Project Structure

- **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  
  The notebook begins with the collection of historical market data. This step includes:
  - Loading data from CSV files or financial APIs.
  - Cleaning data by handling missing values and removing outliers.
  - Normalizing or scaling features to ensure uniformity across variables.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Key technical indicators and statistical measures are computed to capture the dynamics of market behavior. Examples may include:
  - Price returns and volatility measures.
  - Moving averages, momentum indicators, and other derived metrics.
  
  These engineered features serve as the input for the unsupervised learning algorithm.

- **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering):**  
  The core of the project is the application of clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering) to partition the data into distinct groups or market regimes:
  - **Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters:**  
    Techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis might be used to select an appropriate number of clusters.
  - **Interpreting Clusters:**  
    Each cluster is analyzed to understand its characteristics, such as risk profiles or typical price behaviors, which can be associated with different market conditions.

- **Strategy Development & Signal Generation:**  
  Based on the cluster analysis, the notebook outlines how to map cluster membership to trading signals:
  - Define entry and exit criteria when the market transitions between clusters.
  - Incorporate risk management rules to control exposure.
  
  The strategy translates cluster information into actionable buy or sell signals.

- **Backtesting:**  
  A comprehensive backtesting framework is used to evaluate the performance of the trading strategy:
  - **Performance Metrics:**  
    Metrics such as cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and win/loss ratios are calculated.
  - **Simulation of Trades:**  
    Historical simulation is performed to validate the strategy, providing insights into its robustness and potential profitability.
  - **Outcome Analysis:**  
    The results are analyzed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the strategy. For example, one might observe that the strategy performs better in trending markets compared to sideways movements.

## Outcomes and Insights

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2023, the ReturnSPY strategy is observed to outperform the Buy & Hold strategy by a small margin:
  - **Higher Total Return:**  
    ReturnSPY delivered a 2.17% return compared to Buy & Hold's 1.81%.
  - **Better Annualized Return:**  
    ReturnSPY's annualized return of 0.44% slightly exceeds Buy & Hold's 0.37%.
  - **Better Risk-Adjusted Performance:**  
    Despite higher volatility (17.05% vs 14.20%), ReturnSPY has a marginally better Sharpe ratio (-0.09 vs -0.12), indicating improved risk-adjusted returns.
  - **Similar Metrics:**  
    Both strategies show comparable maximum drawdowns and an identical percentage of positive trading days (60%).

- **Key Observations:**  
  It is important to note that neither strategy performed exceptionally well during this period, as both yielded negative Sharpe ratios (indicating returns below the risk-free rate). The slim margin of outperformance suggests that factors like transaction costs or tax implications might reverse this advantage in practical implementation.

- **Pattern Recognition:**  
  The unsupervised learning approach helps in revealing non-obvious patterns in market data, which can be crucial for adapting to different market regimes.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building a quantitative trading strategy using unsupervised learning. By combining robust data preprocessing, thoughtful feature engineering, and rigorous backtesting, the notebook illustrates how machine learning can be applied to generate actionable trading insights and improve decision-making in algorithmic trading.
